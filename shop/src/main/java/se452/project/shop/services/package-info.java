 * @author Alex Sobieraj
 * 
 * Created the CustomerAccountService and implemented the loginAccount, createAccount, and
 * addItemToCart methods. The login and create account were copied over from the grocery app
 * 
 * I learned alot when Implementing the addItmeToCart because I was using an Item object from
 * the grocery application. Interweaving the 2 app a fun challenge.
 * 
 * Feng and I worked on the CustomerAccountMangoService in parallel
